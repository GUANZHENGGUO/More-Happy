# More-Happy
How to make the world a better place.
I want to start an automatic company, with people involved every day, and slowly help more people live a good life. Let the good carry forward and improve the happiness and satisfaction of the people. Let the people stop running to survive, everyone's property is similar.
But I don't have enough alone, I want more people to participate, and we work together to make the world a better place.
Can you give some advice, I would love to get input from others, I believe that together we can achieve it.
